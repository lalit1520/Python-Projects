and predict the new car sales for a given car  model with defined factors. 


TO DO THINGS :
1. Understand the data & perform the data preparation before the model building 
2. Perform all the modeling steps including pre & post modeling steps like data preparation  and implementation of the model 
3. Understand output and explain the model fit 
4. Determine what is the "best" linear model? 
5. Apply transformations to the given variables and find out the possible best model after  transformations. 
6. Generate the final equation 
7. Validate the model and present the results in Excel or PPT.
